# ML-Model-on-Text-Mining-Data-Science-Project
This Project is related to Text Mining and applying Machine Learning Model (Naive Bayes) which is probabilistic Theorem/Model.
Prior Probability and Conditional Probability is applied on Dataset.
{\displaystyle {\text{posterior}}={\frac {{\text{prior}}\times {\text{likelihood}}}{\text{evidence}}}\,}
